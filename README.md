## **About My Personal Knowledge Management System in Obsidian**

Welcome to my Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, structured within the Obsidian platform. This system leverages YAML front matter to add structured metadata to each note, ensuring that my knowledge base is not only organized but also easily query-able and visually differentiated based on content status and type.

### **YAML Front Matter Structure**

Each note within my PKM begins with a YAML front matter section that provides metadata about the note. Here's a breakdown of the structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Note's title"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: "draft/in-review/completed/archived"
summary: "Brief summary of the note's content"
references: ["List of sources or references"]
---
```

### **Rationale Behind Metadata Fields**

- **title**: Ensures consistent metadata and accommodates descriptive names without affecting file naming conventions.
  
- **tags**: Facilitates quick querying and organization based on topics or themes.
  
- **date**: Provides context on note creation or last update.
  
- **status**: Highlights the note's current stage.
  
- **summary**: Enables quick overview without deep diving.
  
- **references**: Crucial for academic or research-oriented notes to cite sources.

### **Visual Customization with CSS**

Based on the `status` metadata in the YAML front matter, notes are visually differentiated:

- **Draft**: Notes have a **red header**.
  ```css
  .status-draft .note-header {
      background-color: #ff6b6b;
  }
  ```

- **In-Review**: Notes have a **yellow header**.
  ```css
  .status-in-review .note-header {
      background-color: #ffe66d;
  }
  ```

- **Completed**: Notes have a **green header**.
  ```css
  .status-completed .note-header {
      background-color: #4caf50;
  }
  ```

- **Archived**: Notes have a **gray header**.
  ```css
  .status-archived .note-header {
      background-color: #9e9e9e;
  }
  ```

### **Integration with Plugins**

This PKM system integrates seamlessly with Obsidian's vast plugin ecosystem. For example, the "Daily Notes" plugin auto-inserts specific YAML metadata for daily entries.

### **Conclusion**

This PKM system, designed around YAML and CSS within Obsidian, showcases the merger of simplicity and structure. If interested in replicating or improving, feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests.
